I wear it.<br />
The face of happiness,<br />
while it boils beneath.<br />
The animated mask that covers that numb froth.

"Ha ha ha!"<br />
Nothing.

But the cracks show.<br />
The pressure grows.<br />
Pushing. Forcing.<br />
I boil. I break.

I vent.<br />
Empty.

The mask is restored.

The pressure builds.
