The tree beckons.<br />
Its twisted limbs reaching out,<br />
calling,<br />
summoning.<br />
The blackened bark of its dead trunk<br />
reflecting the abyss into which it reaches.<br />
The abyss of solitude.<br />
Loneliness.<br />
With each step, the gnarled roots try to catch,<br />
to grab,<br />
to hold and stay,<br />
but on we march,<br />
together,<br />
but alone.

Silence, but for the crunch of leaves.

Your rough skin rubs against me.<br />
Woven tightness,<br />
twisted and threaded.<br />
I feel the knot,<br />
the loop,<br />
the end,<br />
as I throw you up, over that thick, strong, limb.<br />
I tug on you and feel the resistance.<br />
Feel your strength.

The rough black leaves marks on my skin.<br />
Rubbing it away to reveal the weakness.<br />
But it doesn't stay my resolve.<br />
I stand and look out over the emptiness, and see myself.

I step.

Snap.

Into the abyss.

Alone.
