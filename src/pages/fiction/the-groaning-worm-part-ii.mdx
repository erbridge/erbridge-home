  <span>The magicians and phonetic monsters</span>
  <br />
  <span>The mathematicians and physics men</span>
  <br />
  <span>Have their ministries; they waste alongside the terror,</span>
  <br />
  <span>Have their mythology; they work alongside the truth,</span>
  <br />
  <span>Never tasting it; their exhortations are faltering</span>
  <br />
  <span>Never touching it; their equations are false</span>
  <br />
  <span>But the Thanes wait. Or, when grave energies align,</span>
  <br />
  <span>But the things work. Or, when gross error appears,</span>
  <br />
  <span>
    They incant nefarious witchcraft; they dowse the threads of worlds
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>They invent new ones; they drop the theory of waves</span>
  <br />
  <span>In unifying enchantments and invoke cruel stanzas.</span>
  <br />
  <span>In universal ether and imagine curved space.</span>
  <br />
  <span>Nevertheless their exhortations became Hell.</span>
  <br />
  <span>Nevertheless their equations bombed Hiroshima.</span>
  <br />
  <span>The terrifying Thanes waited.</span>
  <br />
  <span>The terrible things worked.</span>
  <br />
  <span>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The priest also
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The poet also
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>Has his ministry. He teaches you the messengers arrived</span>
  <br />
  <span>Has his mythology. He tells you the moon arose</span>
  <br />
  <span>
    Out of the piercing black. He teaches you that Terror was built for a
    violent
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    Out of the Pacific basin. He tells you that Troy was burnt for a vagrant
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>Baleful worm, whose feelers laced a threadless shell.</span>
  <br />
  <span>Beautiful woman, whose face launched a thousand ships.</span>
  <br />
  <span>
    It is unknown: it might be terrible: but chirurgeons and storytellers
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>It is unlikely: it might be true: but church and state</span>
  <br />
  <span>Deliver on more presciently informative mysteries:</span>
  <br />
  <span>Depend on more peculiarly impossible myths:</span>
  <br />
  <span>
    That all monsters are birthed flesh and entrails: commiserate that!
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>That all men are born free and equal: consider that!</span>
  <br />
  <span>And that a worrisome hellfire priest n√©e Judas</span>
  <br />
  <span>And that a wandering Hebrew poet named Jesus</span>
  <br />
  <span>Is the guardian of the unification. Commiserate that!</span>
  <br />
  <span>Is the God of the universe. Consider that!</span>
