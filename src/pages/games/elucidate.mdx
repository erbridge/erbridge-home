A being only reached in dreams cannot converse in human tongue. A entity
existing in such a different plane cannot understand the whims of your kind. You
must try to find a way to communicate with this entity while being restrained by
it's own alien language. Arcana and pictographs reveal an insight into it's
attitude towards you, something that you can and will influence over the course
of the game. The goal is to bridge the gap between you. To change the power
dynamic from ruler and subject into something else. How this changes is up to
you.

elucidate is a code-breaking game, letters correspond to glyphs generated anew
each game and images give clues as to the words being said to you and their
meaning. Reply how you will. Certain answers will make this being feel
differently about you and encourage it to explore different tactics in order to
keep the status quo. There are many different outcomes, and few end well for
you.
