My name is _F_ and I make **games** and **web experiences**. I'm a mathematical
physicist turned programmer, an active contributor to
[open source software](https://github.com/erbridge), and part of
[Sensible Object](http://sensibleobject.com/). I also work under the pseudonym
_erbridge_.

I like to work on projects that support and cultivate the creativity of their
users, that work towards positive social change, that provoke users into
considering new perspectives or emotions, or that push the boundaries of what's
possible. Bonus points if they do more than one of those things.

I'm queer, [agender](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themself), and mentally ill.
These aspects of my identity often influence my work, and I'm very slowly
creating a game about my personal experience with depression. One day I might
finish it. **Watch this space.**

I also dabble in a bunch of other stuff: [short stories](/fiction),
[poetry](/fiction), art, photography, tattooing, to name a few.
