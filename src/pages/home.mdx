My name is _F_ and I make **games**, **web experiences**, and **digital
services**. I'm a mathematical physicist turned software developer, an active
contributor to [open source software](https://github.com/erbridge), and part of
[dxw digital](https://www.dxw.com/), creating public services that improve
people's lives. I also work under the pseudonym _erbridge_.

I like to work on projects that work towards positive social change, that
support and cultivate the creativity of their users, that provoke users into
considering new perspectives or emotions, or that push the boundaries of what's
possible. Bonus points if they do more than one of those things.

I'm queer, [agender](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themself), and mentally ill.
These aspects of my identity often influence my personal work, and I'm very
slowly creating a game about my experience with depression and suicide. One day
I might finish it. **Watch this space.**

I also dabble in a bunch of other stuff: [short stories](/fiction),
[poetry](/fiction), art, photography, tattooing, to name a few.

## Thinking about hiring me?

I'm not currently looking for work, but if you have something that you think
might interest me, and would benefit from my skills, feel free to send me a
[tweet / DM](https://twitter.com/erbridge), or
