My name is _F_ and I make **games** and **web experiences**. I'm a mathematical
physicist turned programmer, and an active contributor to
[open source software](https://github.com/erbridge). I often work under the
pseudonym _erbridge_.

I like to work on projects that support and cultivate the creativity of their
users, that work towards positive social change, that provoke users into
considering new perspectives or emotions, or that push the boundaries of what's
possible. Bonus points if they do more than one of those things.

I'm currently working on an unannounced game about living and coping with
chronic illness and disability. **Watch this space.**

**Thinking about hiring me?** Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/erbridge),
or [email me](mailto:hello@erbridge.co.uk). I'm comfortable anywhere in the
stack.
