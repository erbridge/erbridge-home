My name is Felix Laurie von Massenbach. I'm a mathematical physicist turned programmer, currently freelancing, making games and web experiences. I'm an active contributor to the [open source community](https://github.com/erbridge), and am currently working on *vibrate for you*, a game about anticipation (and sexting).

Thinking about hiring me? Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/erbridge), or [email me](mailto:felix@erbridge.co.uk). I'm comfortable anywhere in the stack.
