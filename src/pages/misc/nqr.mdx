The app I learned to program by building.

Before cloud music services became popular, I wrote NQr so I didn't have to
think about what music to listen to. It uses the music player of your choice to
play music based on how highly you rate it and how long ago you last heard it,
so you hear things you like more frequently than things you don't, but only the
most badly rated are excluded entirely.
