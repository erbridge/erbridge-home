<p class="Poem--interlaced">
<span>The magicians and phonetic monsters</span>\
<span>The mathematicians and physics men</span>\
<span>Have their ministries; they waste alongside the terror,</span>\
<span>Have their mythology; they work alongside the truth,</span>\
<span>Never tasting it; their exhortations are faltering</span>\
<span>Never touching it; their equations are false</span>\
<span>But the Thanes wait. Or, when grave energies align,</span>\
<span>But the things work. Or, when gross error appears,</span>\
<span>They incant nefarious witchcraft; they dowse the threads of worlds</span>\
<span>They invent new ones; they drop the theory of waves</span>\
<span>In unifying enchantments and invoke cruel stanzas.</span>\
<span>In universal ether and imagine curved space.</span>\
<span>Nevertheless their exhortations became Hell.</span>\
<span>Nevertheless their equations bombed Hiroshima.</span>\
<span>The terrifying Thanes waited.</span>\
<span>The terrible things worked.</span>\
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The priest also</span>\
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The poet also</span>\
<span>Has his ministry. He teaches you the messengers arrived</span>\
<span>Has his mythology. He tells you the moon arose</span>\
<span>Out of the piercing black. He teaches you that Terror was built for a
violent</span>\
<span>Out of the Pacific basin. He tells you that Troy was burnt for a vagrant</span>\
<span>Baleful worm, whose feelers laced a threadless shell.</span>\
<span>Beautiful woman, whose face launched a thousand ships.</span>\
<span>It is unknown: it might be terrible: but chirurgeons and
storytellers</span>\
<span>It is unlikely: it might be true: but church and state</span>\
<span>Deliver on more presciently informative mysteries:</span>\
<span>Depend on more peculiarly impossible myths:</span>\
<span>That all monsters are birthed flesh and entrails: commiserate
that!</span>\
<span>That all men are born free and equal: consider that!</span>\
<span>And that a worrisome hellfire priest n√©e Judas</span>\
<span>And that a wandering Hebrew poet named Jesus</span>\
<span>Is the guardian of the unification. Commiserate that!</span>\
<span>Is the God of the universe. Consider that!</span>
