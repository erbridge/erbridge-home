We're making a game!

[Luke Tovee](http://www.luketovee.com/) and I have started working on a resource
management sim, where you play as the leader of a fledgling town of house boats,
moored around a desert island (that doesn't do the concept justice). We're
calling it _The Island_.

I'll be rearranging code into pretty shapes, while Luke does magic in 3D. I plan
on documenting the process, to record design decisions and mistakes for us to
look back on and learn from. And hopefully someone else will find something
useful in here too.

Onwards!
