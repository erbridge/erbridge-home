The rituals we use to fight our inner demons, and the lengths we'll go for those
we love. To The End is a top-down 2-player narrative puzzle game where one
player strives to escape from a nightmare, and the other manipulates the
environment to keep them there.

Initially made for
[Global Game Jam 2016](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/end-0).
