Blindfield is a game about two blind beachcombers searching for treasure in a
minefield.

This is a game played with an audience. Two players share an Xbox controller,
holding one side each behind their backs. They stand so they are unable to see
the screen.

The audience _can_ see the screen and should be able to be heard by the players
(but the game should be turned up loud).

Each player controls one of the coloured circles on the screen. They both have
metal detectors that work in different ways. One of them has a long range
detector that vibrates when they are moving in the direction of the treasure,
but gets weaker as it gets closer. The other has a short range detector that
gets stronger, the closer it gets to the treasure. When both players are
standing on the treasure, they win.

The audience is tasked with guiding the two players, to help them find each
other without stepping on any mines. If they fail and step on a mine: game over.

The game was made during [Splash Jam 2016](http://www.splash-jam.com/), which
you can read more about [here](/blog/splash-jam-2016).
